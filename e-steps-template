    Amount marked: 100mm
    GCode Relative Extrusion Set (M83)?:  
    Amount Extruded(run 3 times): ( , , ) # G1 E100 F100
    #Calculate New E-steps:
     # 1. (Amount Marked - how much extruded (negative value for less than 100mm extruded))
     # 2. (steps / mm value ) * 100 = steps taken
     # 3. (steps taken / actual length extruded) = accurate steps/mm value # we'll put this number into the firmware

    Result:   # goes into printer firmware M92 E###.#,  save with M500
    #Restart Printer
    #Run M503 - check M92 E-value  - Confirm it changed
