    Date of calibration (mm/dd/yy): 11/20/21
    Material:  PLA
    Color: White
    Brand: Overture
    Tolerence: +- .05
    HotEnd Temp (c): 210
    Start e-steps from firmware: 93
    Amount marked (mm): 100
    GCode Relative Extrusion Set (M83)?:  yes
    Amount Extruded(run 3 times): ( -6.54, -7.15 , -7.42) # G1 E100 F100
    #Calculate New E-steps:
     # 1. (Amount Marked - how much extruded (negative value for less than 100mm extruded))
     # 2. (steps / mm value ) * 100 = steps taken
     # 3. (steps taken / actual length extruded) = accurate steps/mm value # we'll put this number into the firmware 
    Math Calculations:
    1: 93 mm extruded
    2:  (93 / 100)*100 = 93
    3:  93/93 = 1 (or 100)
    Result:   # goes into printer firmware M92 E###.#,  save with M500
    #Restart Printer
    #Run M503 - check M92 E-value  - Confirm it changed
